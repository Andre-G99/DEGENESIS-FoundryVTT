  "adventurer": "<p>Folly, recklessness, and the search for physical and mental limits are the Adventurer’s driving force. He continually confronts situations beyond his abilities. If he survives, he gains experience and looks for new motivations. The Adventurer never stays in one place for too long, because there is too much to discover. There are ruins to explore, passages to take, Clans to fi nd. He embraces fear as a friend; without it, everything is boring. Nothing is worse than the boredom and predictability of a normal day.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Body</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(AGI) Mobility<br/>(INS) Orienteering</p>",
  "creator": "<p>Everything crumbles. Humans simply die. Only their buildings and inventions, the knowledge from their lifetime, survives. The need to leave their legacy, to keep their name from being forgotten, is what drives Creators. They are constantly working meticulously, seeking the biggest challenges to prove themselves worthy by mastering them. They build monoliths, construct defensive walls for villages, weld together pipes for irrigation systems, or consider the awakening of the Stream their life’s work. Nothing motivates a Creator more than the desire to build a monument to his name through his endeavors.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>AGILITY</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(CHA) Arts<br/>(INT) Engineering</p>",
  "mentor": "<p>Teaching and learning have raised humanity above the state of animals. The Mentor lives in this tradition and shares his knowledge with chosen disciples. He sees himself in them, immortalizes himself and his knowledge through them. He grooms their curiosity and teaches them. One day they will continue his work, and the cycle will continue.</p><p>Indifference towards the marvels of the world, stubbornness, and stupidity are the banes of humanity. The Mentor disdains those afflicted by them.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INTELLECT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(CHA) Leadership<br/>(INT) Legends</p>",
  "martyr": "<p>Self-sacrifice unto self-abandonment is the Martyr’s purpose in life. He gains strength and power from protecting the weak, charging into the fray first, working when everyone else has given up. He suffers for others. The Martyr knows that his solitary actions are more inspiring than any flaming speech. His principles are adamant. They are his shield, his armor, and his weapon at once, a blazing example of willpower and faithfulness. As a paragon, he feels bulletproof. Nothing can make him surrender.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Faith/Willpower<br/>(BOD) Toughness</p>",
  "ruler": "<p>Control is the only way to reach a goal. Most people are mindless cockroaches that need taming. There are tasks to assign and orders to shout. If you let the reins slacken even once, the world tumbles into chaos. The Ruler must lead his flock, be beyond all question, make the right decisions, and lead in person if the people do not recognize his wisdom. Nothing is more frightening for the Ruler than assigning responsibility and power to others.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>CHARISMA</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Cunning<br/>(CHA) Leadership</p>",
  "seeker": "<p>Where do we come from, and where do we go? The questions of life and death vex the Seeker. He wants to unravel the mysteries of the world, dissect them down to the bones, ask questions no one has ever asked before— and answer them. What is behind the 2 to the power of 16 phenomenon? Where did the asteroids come from? What is the nature of the Primer? Was this really the first impact? The Seeker digs in the thicket of the past and in the labs of the present for explanations, but time is hot on his heels.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INTELLECT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INT) Artifact lore<br/>(INT) Science</p>",
  "healer": "<p>The Healer sees the world’s collapse and fights it. Whether it is a physical wound, barren soil, a burned-out mind, or broken technology, the Healer sees it as his task to rebuild the old order. You can splinter the bone, water the dry soil, and repair an old boat. Everything he does he does meticulously so the collapse will not endanger his work´ again the next day. The Healer gives up on nothing that is not beyond hope.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>AGILITY</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INT) Medicine<br/>(AGI) Crafting</p>",
  "traditionalist": "<p>Order is safety; it separates the humans from the apes. It prevents humanity from wandering aimlessly and falling prey to the next pack of Gendos. Those who stay true to the traditions, honor the family and act accordingly, chase chaos from the world. Anarchy is anathema to the traditionalist. He implores people to look to the past when today’s questions are hard to bear. He clings to the ancient rules, never adapting them, no matter what happens. It would sweep him off his feet. He hates change, only wanting to guarantee continuity.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INT) Legends<br/>(CHA) Conduct</p>",
  "mediator": "<p>If we all spoke the same language, strife and misunderstandings would be no more. The Mediator sees himself as a speaker for all parties, looks for peace in harmony, implores and pacifies. He internalizes the parties’ motives, pointing out common ground to the squabblers and sharpening their understanding for each other. Shouting and loud words are not the Mediator’s way. Emotion must take second place to reason.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INS) Perception<br/>(CHA) Negotiation</p>",
  "hermit": "<p>People chatter all the time, so much so that every thought drowns in the sea of spoken inanities that constantly surround us. The hermit does not want companionship. He dislikes everybody. He does not want to communicate and is not interested in the stories of others. In a group, he always flees to the fringe, needing his distance from the din of the world. Life as a loner is so much better. No responsibility towards anybody: being left to his own devices makes the Hermit happy. Only in absolute solitude does he find peace.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INS) Survival<br/>(AGI) Stealth</p>",
  "heretic": "<p>The Heretic does not believe in anything, and nothing is sacred to him. Rules, religions, traditions: everything can and must be scrutinized. He looks for glitches in the system, wants to shake others’ faith. Rebellion, revolts, and riots are the Heretic’s brands. He wants to destroy the stagnation and the traditions, wants to see precious civilization shatter against its own ideals. He casts doubt, and that is good. The more people deviate from their ways, the larger his fellowship.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Cunning<br />(CHA) Expression</p>",
  "conqueror": "<p>The Conqueror only exists between the poles of competing powers. To him, every battle is a power struggle; every decision is a move in the game of life. Victory means everything to him; only losers blather about morale. The Conqueror finds power in his ego’s exorbitance; his hubris drives him towards great deeds. He considers modesty false and vain; he brags about his successes.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Body</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(BOD) Toughness<br/>(BOD) Force</p>",
  "abomination": "<p>Some people have seen too much. Something within them has broken, guiding their thoughts down strange paths. No one wants to be around them. The ways of the Abomination disturb those who meet him. His proximity makes them shiver. He sucks in the fright he awakens in others like mother’s milk. It nourishes and disturbs him, adding to his weirdness. He loves getting lost in fantasies and seeing the fire of fear burn in his opponent’s eyes. When others realize that he has shed any civilized emotions like compassion or responsibility, they see a feral beast looking at them through his eyes. Madness squats in the Abomination’s brain. He is a clockwork bomb without clockwork. Tick tock.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Domination<br/>(BOD) Toughness</p>",
  "destroyer": "<p>To make room for something new, everything old has to die. According to this principle, the Destroyer fully gives in to madness. Everyone is an enemy, and one life will not be enough to destroy them all. He hunts his enemies to the four corners of the world, fighting them, eradicating them. Even if he claims to act for a greater cause, he actually acts for his own sake. When something new grows after the destruction, he has long since moved on. He never looks back.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(BOD) Stamina<br/>(BOD) Force</p>",
  "chosen": "<p>People come running to see him, to bask in his glory. Others have always listened to every word the chosen said. All of his words sounded wise. That had its consequences: he sees himself as the solution to every problem. He is the sword splitting apart the Gordian knot, and he is the Messiah that the congregation has awaited. His presence inspires the people, for good or for bad. Those who disdain him and call him a fraud are damned in their faithlessness in his eyes.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>CHARISMA</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(CHA) Expression<br/>(CHA) Leadership</p>",
  "defiler": "<p>The Defiler wears a cloak of envy. Why should others always get more than he does? Why should they be happier, more beautiful, stronger? The Defiler cannot stand other people’s joy. When he drags them down into the muck, when he kicks up a cloud of dust, when he sets lovers at each other’s throats, he fulfils his destiny. The Defiler rules over all those who always feel aggrieved and blame others for it.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Deception<br/>(PSY) Domination</p>",
  "protector": "<p>The world is full of treasures, small ones and big ones, and they all need protection. The Protector stands in front of his charges like a tower, whether they are people or objects. He wants to preserve things, be they artefacts, cultural achievements, or human life. Whatever the Protector dedicates himself to, he protects with his life until he himself is destroyed.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>Psyche</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(BOD) Stamina<br/>(BOD) Toughness</p>",
  "visionary": "<p>When knowledge finally steps out of time and into the foreground of reality, the Visionary has already seen it. He sees the course of the future, thinks decades ahead, accuses unbelievers, and implores people to be reasonable. He hopes to pave the way for a better tomorrow. His intellect and his visions determine humanity’s progress.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>CHARISMA</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(CHA) Seduction<br/>(PSY) Cunning</p>",
  "zealot": "<p>The Zealot’s faith moves mountains. He toils and suffers beyond human understanding, knowing no limits. His power comes from his devotion to his Lord. He would die for his religion, his Cult, and his ideology, and he proves his worth for the cause day by day. He burns with madness, singeing the minds of those around him until nothing remains but ash drifting in the wind and blazing faith.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Reaction<br/>(PSY) Faith/Willpower</p>",
  "disciple": "<p>Knowledge is like an ocean the Disciple will travel on for all his life. He follows great teachers, looking for the Bygones’ forgotten libraries, forever driven by his curiosity. He is enormously knowledgeable, but it is never enough. He carries many ways of life and specializations within him, but he can never decide on one path.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>CHARISMA</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INS) Empathy<br/>(INS) Perception</p>",
  "righteous": "<p>Action and conscience are inseparable, and the Righteous conscience is pure. He sees the world in stark contrasts, and people around him consider him self-righteous. Indeed, he passes up no opportunity to implement his idea of righteousness. As a keeper of questions of faith or law, he judges everyone, every deed, every people, even every emotion. Everything is either good or bad. He never doubts himself.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INTELLECT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(PSY) Cunning<br/>(CHA) Negotiation</p>",
  "traveler": "<p>The Traveller must wander the world to grow by experiencing it and its people. He collects impressions and experiences like others collect Gendo skulls, but he does not keep them to himself. He spreads good and bad news, connecting the hinterland to the metropolis, linking Clans and Cults. He is restless; he longs for the road.</p><h3>Attribute bonus</h3><p>INSTINCT</p><h3>Skill bonus</h3><p>(INT) Legends<br/>(INS) Orienteering</p>",
